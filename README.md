### commands to run project

frontend- NPM start to run
backend- node server.js

- There's a bug when it comes to the frontend ux, when the use chooses yes or no for if there is foam in the picture.
  - the backend works and gets updated (so the bug is purly in the frontend)
  - I would have liked, to comeback and fix that bug.
- I would have also like to style the application better.

Thank you,
